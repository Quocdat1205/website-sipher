            "A Dutch Auction is a type of auction that has been traditionally used for buying or selling goods. This type of auction is characterized by starting with a higher asking price or bid, and then the price gets lower as time goes by until a buyer accepts the price. In the case of NFTs, the main difference is that there are multiple items for sale - typically the amount of public sale slots available for minting - but the core concept remains the same. The NFT minting cost starts out at a higher price, but as time goes by, the price will periodically get lowered at specific increments set by the NFT issuers, which provides buyers with opportunities to mint their NFTs at the price they are willing to pay.",

However, the main difference is that instead of having a traditional launch in which buyers wait for the minting to start and then being pit against one another in a gas war, the Auction will start at the established launch time with a starting price will be 0.9 ETH. Afterwards, the price will programmatically drop every 10 minutes in decrements of 0.05, with the lowest price for the auction being 0.1 ETH.",

            "At 10 minutes for each price point, the Dutch Auction will reach its lowest price of 0.1 ETH after a duration of approximately 2 hours and 40 minutes, assuming that there are still any available NEKOs for sale at that point.",
